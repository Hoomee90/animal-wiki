    <h1>Notsnake</h1>

    <p class="card-text">The infinite legged notsnake is believed to belong to the same family as the ungod, although lines of research on this theory will never be completed, for obvious reasons. Notsnakes eat everything that is not a small mammal, insect, lizard, amphibian or egg. They are exceptionally friendly, and their venom is know to have regenerative properties.</p>

  <div id="ontovore" class="hidden infocard">
    <h1>Ontovore</h1>
    <img src="imgs/ontovore.png" alt="An image of an ontovore">
    <p class="card-text">The ontovore is an invasive species of metaparasite, beings that feed on higher concepts. Ontovores in specific feed on the property of existing that all ontological concepts have, including themselves. As a result of this process they derealize everything they come in contact with. The ultimate actors of entropy, they are the final fate of every universe, including ours. They are already here.</p>
